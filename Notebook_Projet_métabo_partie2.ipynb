    "On met le lower bound à 0 pour toutes les réactions d’échange afin de bloquer l’import de tous les métabolites et de partir d’un milieu sans apport externe. On réactive ensuite l’import uniquement pour les métabolites que l’on souhaite autoriser dans le milieu étudié. Cette démarche permet de définir précisément les conditions environnementales du modèle et de contrôler les métabolites que le modèle peut importer, afin d’analyser les flux métaboliques dans le milieu étudié."
